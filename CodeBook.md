The variables used in the data set are as below.
Subjects are numbered 1 to 30.
Activities are self-explanatory, transformed from numbers by the analysis script
(run_analysis.R).
They were obtained from the larger UCI data set by extracting
only those mentioning mean or std. Further, for each variable,
only the mean value for each pair of subject and activity 
(first two columns of the file means_by_subject_and_activity.txt)
 is reported.

# The variables have 6 distinguishing features:
* Body vs. Gravity:
    * Those variables mentioning Gravity are measures of the force of gravity at
    a given time, while those mentioning Body measure the movement of the person's own body.
* Acceleration vs. Gyro:
    * Those variables mentioning Acceleration were measured using the accelerometer,
    while those mentioning Gyro were measured using the gyroscope.
* Jerk vs. absence:
    * Those variables mentioning Jerk represent further calculations on those without
    to calculate Jerk signals.
* Magnitude vs. X, Y, or Z axis:
    * Those variables mentioning Magnitude result from calculating the Euclidean norm of the
    three dimensional axes (see below)>
    * Those variables mentioning X-, Y-, or Z-axis represent motion in one of those three dimensions.
* FFT vs. absence:
    * Those variables mentioning FFT were derived from the application of a Fast-Fourier Transform
    of the respective alternate variables.
* Mean vs. std
    * As discussed, only the mean and standard deviation (std) for each variable were reported.
